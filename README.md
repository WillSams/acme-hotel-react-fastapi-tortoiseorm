# Acme Hotel Example - React, FastAPI, TortoiseORM

This example contains a frontend and backend:

- The frontend is a [React](https://react.dev) application using [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for view templating.
- The backend is a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org) providing the ability to create, delete, and list reservatios plus available rooms for a given date range.

For a solution that use the MVC architecture for the frontend, check out my [Express-FastAPI-SqlAlchemy](https://github.com/WillSams/acme-hotel-express-fastapi-sqlalchemy) version of this same idea.
